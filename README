INTRODUCTION

  This package is a proposed replacement for pod2text and Pod::Text in the
  current Perl distribution.  The modules contained in it use Pod::Parser
  rather than doing the POD parsing themselves, and are designed to be
  object-oriented and very easy to subclass.  As an example, two useful
  subclasses of Pod::SimpleText are also included:  Pod::Text::Color,
  which uses ANSI color escape sequences to highlight text, and
  Pod::Text::Termcap, which determines the correct control sequences to
  embolden and underline text from terminal termcap information.

  The output of Pod::SimpleText should be identical to the output of the
  original Pod::Text module, except for fixed bugs.  This has been tested
  by comparing the output of both modules when run on perlfunc.pod from
  the Perl 5.005_02 distribution, and also by comparing output for several
  other shorter pages.

  Known bugs fixed relative to Pod::Text:  The first line of text after an
  =item command is wrapped correctly, various problems with L<> text have
  been fixed, and if you use Pod::Text::Termcap, the termcap sequences
  work correctly and use POSIX termios to determine the terminal speed.

  There are also a number of additional features, mostly finer control of
  the output of the module under a variety of circumstances.  The
  programmatic interface is also cleaner.


INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.  This will also install a
  driver script named pod2txt; see it's man page for more information.

  Note that in order to use Pod::Text::Color, you have to have the module
  Term::ANSIColor (available from CPAN) installed.


THANKS

  To Tom Christiansen, for writing the original Pod::Text.  This module is
  based very heavily on that, particularly the termcap handling, and its
  output is designed to mimic the output of that module.

  To Brad Appleton, for writing Pod::Parser, which made writing this
  entire package the work of a single Saturday.
